    "What is the average mileage of a car?": "The average mileage of a car depends on the model, but it's typically between 20 to 30 miles per gallon.",
    "How often should I change my engine oil?": "It's recommended to change your engine oil every 5,000 to 7,500 miles.",
    "What does ABS mean in a car?": "ABS stands for Anti-lock Braking System, which helps maintain traction during emergency braking.",
    "How do I maintain my car battery?": "Regularly check the terminals for corrosion and ensure the battery is charged properly.",
    "What is the difference between petrol and diesel cars?": "Diesel engines are generally more fuel-efficient and have more torque, while petrol engines are smoother and quieter.",
    "When should I replace my tires?": "You should replace your tires every 25,000 to 50,000 miles or when the tread depth is below 2/32 of an inch.",
